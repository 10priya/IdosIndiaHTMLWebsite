	          enable the business to prepare financial statements and file tax returns&#44; which are consequential requirements and not the primary reason
	          for which a business is set up&#46; Rather&#44; the technology must empower the business to become profitable through efficiency in operations
	          and also by enabling the business to overcome key challenges including working capital management and ensuring reduced cost of sales&#46;
	          Further the technology must enable the business to engage effectively with the eco&#45;system in which it operates including its customers&#44;
	          suppliers&#44; staff and other stakeholders and such engagement must help the business to generate more profits&#46; This is what IDOS delivers&#44;

        <p>
          <strong>Reduced turnaround time for accounting &amp; financial processes</strong><br>
          &#34;Organizations which have two or more branches find it challenging to ensure consistency of transaction processing and reporting across all the branches&#46; The staff at the branches come with different educational or academic background and they may not be trained on these processes nor on the software&#44; thus making it necessary to get them trained before they can handle the responsibilities independently&#46;
          If there is attrition&#44; then the process of hiring&#44; training and getting new staff ready to handle the responsibilities will have a gestation period during which there could be process delays impacting the accounting activity&#46; Due to its ease of use&#44; IDOS does not require the users to be knowledgeable either in accounting or in technology and therefore any member of staff can process transactions and eliminate the hurdles associated with attrition&#46; This enhances the overall process efficiency and consequently reduces the turnaround time with respect to accounting and financial processes of the business&#34;
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Internal financial controls</strong><br>
          &#34;Medium sized businesses which have multiple branches and employees across different branches and departments&#44; need to implement internal financial controls to ensure that the organization functions in accordance to certain protocols and also in compliance to regulatory requirements&#46; These controls would provide the assurance that the processes are being carried out as per defined protocols that the management has established and would also help in reduction of discrepancies&#46; IDOS is one of the only software which has developed and inbuilt internal controls for all accounting transactions in a way that the transaction is subjected to real&#45;time internal audit even before it is posted to ledgers&#44; thereby ensuring the highest levels of data accuracy and data reliability&#46;&#34;

          <strong>Remote supervision</strong><br>
          &#34;Remote&#44; on&#45;site working and work from home models are becoming necessary in the current digital business eco system&#46; This requires the management to have staff&#44; work away from the physical office and therefore it is important to supervise their work and also ensure that they are completing their tasks in compliance to protocols&#46; IDOS provides the managements a unique capability to ensure that all the employees are managing the accounting &amp; financial processes in accordance to pre&#45;defined protocols&#46; The managers can get a dashboard view of reports relating to any remote location&#44; branch or project in real&#45;time&#44; empowering them to take any action in real&#45;time&#46; Further IDOS informs the managers through emails&#44; any action / activity that is required to be completed at every location and ensures that managers are informed&#44; in advance if something important is required to be addressed&#44; by the staff at remote location&#46;&#34;
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Uniformity across the organization</strong><br>
          &#34;A typical Medium sized business may have several branches or projects&#44;has high volume of transactions and it delegates work to its employees&#46;Thus it is imperative that the organization automates its processes to ensure that there is uniformity across all branches all transactions and all employees&#46; IDOS helps business adopt automation and technology with ease&#46; IDOS provides a positive user experience because it is easy to use&#44; this ensures high adoption rate among all employees and infuses process automation across the entire company&#46;&#34;
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Real&#45;time decision&#45;making reports</strong><br>
          Such businesses require real&#45;time reports relating to financial performance of its branches&#44; projects and business segments so that the management can take necessary action to ensure that every business segment is profitable&#46; IDOS can be accessed via internet and therefore&#44; the reports are updated as the transactions are processed&#44; enabling the management to monitor the different business segments in real&#45;time&#46;
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Accuracy &amp; reliability of data</strong><br>
          Where the volume of transactions is high&#44; it is important to ensure that there are no human errors in the accounting process&#44; since such errors cause rework&#44; reconciliations&#44; increase in the turnaround time and increase in the cost of operations&#46; Since accounting automation and real&#45;time reconciliation are built into IDOS&#44; the chances of human error are significantly reduced&#44; making the data highly reliable and actionable&#46;
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Seamless integration</strong><br>
          Companies have multiple cross functional and cross departmental processes which have direct or indirect impact on accounting and financial management&#46; These processes could be relating to manufacture&#44; sales&#44; procurement&#44; e&#45;commerce or a specific kind of service such as medical or legal&#46; These processes are managed using different applications since the existing accounting software do not have cross functional capabilities&#46; This results in issues relating to data migration and data integration for the purpose of accounting and also for reporting&#46;
          IDOS is an end to end accounting&#44; finance&#44; compliance and business management application with all capabilities in&#45;built into the application&#46; It not only enables the business to manage accounting&#44; but also empowers the business to seamlessly integrate processes across different business segments and provides a consolidated corporate dashboard across multiple measurable parameters&#46;
